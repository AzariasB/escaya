# The EScaya AST specification

Escaya's own `AST` represents the structure of an ECMAScript program as a tree and conforms to the [ECMAScriptÂ® 2021 specs](https://tc39.es/ecma262/index.html). The AST have been designed for performance, and it nearly eliminates the chance of accidentally creating an AST that does not represent an ECMAScript program while also requiring fewer bytes than the AST produced by ESTree and Babel.

## Script and Module

 A javaScript program can be either [a script or a module](https://tc39.github.io/ecma262/index.html#sec-ecmascript-language-scripts-and-modules) as
 defined in the `ES2015` specs and later.


```js
interface Script {
    type: string;
    directives: [ Directives ];
    leafs: [ Statement | ModuleDeclaration ];
    start: number;
    end: number;
}
```

## Module

```js
interface Module {
    type: string;
    directives: [ Directives ];
    leafs: [ Statement | ModuleDeclaration ];
    start: number;
    end: number;
}
```

'leafs' are used for every new block scope.

## Error recovery

In `error recovery mode` the `RootNode` represent both `Module` and `Script`, and the
current `mutualFlags` property keeps track of which context you are currently parsing in.

The `mutualFlags` property contains a serie of bit masks that can be parsed by reference, and this
information isn't known from outside or exposed through any API.

```js
interface RootNode {
    kind: SyntaxKind;
    directives: [ Directives ];
    leafs: [ Statement | ModuleDeclaration ];
    text: string;
    filename: string;
    mutualFlags: Flags,
    diagnostics [ Diagnostics ];
    parent: Script | Module | null;
    children: [ Statement | ModuleDeclaration ];
    length: number;
    end: number;
}
```

## SyntaxNode

```js
interface SyntaxNode {
    type: string;
    start?: number;
    end?: number;
}
```
